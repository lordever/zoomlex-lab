**Zoomlex lab**

Hi. This is my labarotory for testing some java script features

**How to run**

Just start index.js and you will see the result of function in console. 

For starting it make `node index.js` in the root folder.

Before you will start, you need to change code in index.js which will show other example

For example you need to call `LabFactory.makeMsgLogging().showCase()` 

The LabFactory has next examples:
1. makeMsgLogging - the simple example which shows how to create new example
